# TCA9548A I2C Multiplexor

The TCA9548A is an i2c multiplexor.  It allows you to connect multiple devices with the same address to the i2c bus.

## Python code for the Raspberry Pi
This is a very basic program to allow you to use the TCA9548A with a Raspberry Pi. It does not have any special features, but can easily be modified to include them.  It was written for Python 2.x, and may require some modification to work with later versions of Python.

## SMBus
This program uses smbus.  Any recent version is likely to work as only basic functions are used.
